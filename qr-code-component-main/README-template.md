### Continued development

I have more to improve with my style.Need more improvement in my Javascript,and arrangement of my html and Css to have a clean and accurate code.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for the arrange of element in html and reducing images in css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand border radius more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
